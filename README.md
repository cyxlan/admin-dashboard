## Applied skills
- Combined CSS grid and flexbox to lay out design of elements
	- Implemented nested grids for complex layout positioning
	- Used `auto-fit` and `minmax()` to responsively resize and wrap grid elements on different browser widths
- Used `rem` units to relatively size text and size elements relative to text
